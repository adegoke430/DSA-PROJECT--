###  Key Insights

- ₹200–₹500 priced products with high ratings are optimal for promotion  
- Best visibility is achieved with **30–60% discounts**  
- Low-rated but heavily discounted products may require quality improvements
- Customer reviews revealed that products with higher star ratings and detailed positive feedback tend to drive more engagement and repeat purchases. Categories like electronics and beauty products receive the most reviews, but also face the highest number of complaints—mostly around quality and delivery delays. Discounts and competitive pricing noticeably boost visibility, but they don’t guarantee better reviews unless product quality matches expectations.

  ### Recommendations
- Under-reviewed products should be targeted for review campaigns
- Focus on improving product quality and delivery speed, especially in high-review categories like electronics and beauty, where complaints are most common. Encourage happy customers to leave reviews, as strong ratings drive trust and repeat purchases. Use discounts wisely—pair them with product improvements, not just lower prices. Monitor negative reviews closely to fix recurring issues and adjust marketing to reflect customer feedback. Small improvements based on reviews can significantly boost credibility and long-term sales.
